Welcome to my notes.

# Not a Library

I'd considered it, but until I can prove it, there's nothing here that rises to the level of a publishable library.
Consider this a collection of compilable notes, reminders, "tips and tricks" guidance gathered over the years. 
It's too diverse to be a single library, and there's a lot of collected text that wouldn't fit in one anyway. 
Each idea is here just as a reference, a starter, a jumping off point for building and rebuilding. 
Thanks for stopping by!

## Work in progress, in public
Like a lot of `(engine|develop)ers`, I'm a little bit scattered. 
Not so far as to diagnose or medicate myself with anything stronger than caffeine, but enough to know that it affects
the pattern of my work.
I'm also doing this in my _spare time_: 
it's "on the side," but with an intentiona utter lack of "hustle."
This is a space for, if not meditation, then slow consideration of what (and who) makes code work.
Little-'a' architecture, as the mood strikes, by way of Twain's "tank method."

For these reasons, I don't see this project as ever being "done." It will perpetually be in version `0.x`, with arbitrarily large values of `x`. 

Well, that's not entirely true. I might change my mind in a "breaking" way. 
Lord knows that's happened enough times in the past that my hubris is (mostly) broken on that point. 
I'm still learning, and still learning to ride that line between humility and false humility.
The former by retaining a sense of wonder about the complexity and beauty in even the ugliest code;
the latter by recognizing that I do have something to offer developers trapped in prisons of their own design.

Nonetheless, slow and breaking as they are, in the spirit of "agile" those changes will happen in public. 
Changes in direction won't "overwrite" the old, they will happen alongside and with notes—and apologies—about the shift. 
Major versions maintained side-by-side, if you will. The history of it all preserved in Git. In a sense, a blog with time in two dimensions. Documents growing, edited, refined, in parallel, in fits and starts ("scattered," remember).

As of this writing this is certainly an "alpha version". I'll try to remember to update that sentence if that changes, but this kind of work is always, perpetually, "in progress."
