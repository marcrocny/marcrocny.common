Welcome to my notes.

# Not a Library

I'd considered it, but until I can prove it, there's nothing here that rises to the level of a publishable library. These are more just compilable notes or reminders or "tips and tricks" I've collected. It's too diverse to be a single library. Each idea is here just as a reference, a starter, a jumping off point for building and rebuilding. Thanks for stopping by!
